Helping develop the UMN rocket team's proprietary WINGS software used for data analysis during and after rocket launches. 
Being a full stack engineering project, I'm contributing by helping build a robust type-safe Rust back-end that supports live 
telemetry reception through a USB port and handles data processing, and a front-end written in TypeScript for data visualization 
that features graph displays, indicator light displays, and more. Frameworks utilized include Tauri, SolidJS, and Tailwind CSS. 
Helping to conduct end-to-end testing to ensure that the rest of the team can confidently visualize and interpret data in order to 
fine-tune their projects.

WINGS is the UMN Rocket Team's proprietary software that's used for data analysis during and after rocket launches. I joined
the team at the start of my junior year \(September 2024)
