WINGS is the UMN Rocket Team's proprietary software that's used for data analysis during and after rocket launches. I joined
the team at the start of my junior year (September 2024), and have since helped contribute to building the software's robust
memory and type safe back-end using Rust and the front-end using TypeScript. The software supports both live telemetry reception
through a USB port and also playback of data from previous launches through various file formats. The front-end can display processed 
data for visualization with its graph, indicator light, and readout displays.

    Indicator Lights
</h3>

My first major contribution was creating the boolean indicator light display for the front-end. This included creating both the
display and the settings modal. The boolean indicator lights help users monitor variables by using display lights
to indicate whether the incoming data satisfies the specified inequalities or not. The lights turn green when the conditions are met,
or turn red otherwise

    Altus Metrum Checksum
</h3>

I added checksum calculations to detect accidental changes/errors in incoming telemetry data in our Altus Metrum/AltOS file handler. 
The rocket team uses Altus Metrum products like the TeleMetrum altimeter with GPS and RF telemetry link and the TeleDongle which is 
used on the ground station to interact with the rockets. By adding CRC checking for AltOS packets, I was able to filter out bad packets 
sent using these products and drastically enhance the display of rocket data. This WINGS feature works for both live data sent from the 
TeleMetrum and data saved to a file.
