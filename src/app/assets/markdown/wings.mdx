WINGS is the UMN Rocket Team's proprietary software that's used to display data during and after rocket launches. I joined
the team at the start of my junior year (September 2024), and have since helped contribute to building the software's robust
memory and type safe back-end using Rust and the front-end using TypeScript. I will be taking on the role of leading the software
subteam starting next Fall. \
\
The software supports both live telemetry reception through a USB port and also playback of data from 
previous launches through different file formats. The front-end can display processed data for visualization with its graph, indicator 
light, 3D model, and readout displays. The project was selected by the rocket team to be the focus of the team's podium presentation
at the

because of the software's unique capability to be able to work with a variety of flight computers from different brands, which typically 
requires the usage of multiple ground stations, making WINGs one of the few systems out there that provide a universal ground station.

    Indicator Lights
</h3>

My first major contribution was creating the boolean indicator light display for the front-end. This included creating both the
settings modal and the display itself. The boolean indicator lights help users monitor variables by using display lights
to indicate whether the incoming data satisfies the specified inequalities or not. The lights turn green when the conditions are met,
or turn red otherwise.

    Altus Metrum Checksum
</h3>

In my first back-end project, I added checksum calculations to detect accidental changes/errors in incoming telemetry data in our Altus Metrum/AltOS file handler. 
The rocket team uses Altus Metrum products like the TeleMetrum altimeter with GPS and RF telemetry link and the TeleDongle which is 
used on the ground station to interact with the rockets. By adding checksum calculations for AltOS packets, I was able to filter out bad packets 
sent using these products and remarkably enhance the display of rocket data. This WINGS feature works for both live data sent from the 
TeleMetrum and data saved to a file.

    Zoom-Capable Graphs
</h3>

I integrated the ability to zoom in or out on graphs, a long-awaited yet useful feature for data visualization. Users have the ability 
to zoom in on data, and drag the x-axis horizontally in order to get a closer look at older or newer data. Additionally, I created a new 
display element which has a fixed x-axis and works by displaying new data on the right while pushing out old data to the left, 
creating a sliding window or oscilloscope-style effect. This new display is useful for realtime display of time-series data.

    Other Contributions
</h3>

Other contributions I've made to the project include improving the functionality and styling of all of the settings modals for the
displays, adding help text/documentation throughout to improve software ease-of-use, conducting end-to-end testing to ensure implemented
features work, and other various small front-end improvements. One of the most rewarding aspects of working on this project has been
being able to develop software within a collaborative, team environment.
